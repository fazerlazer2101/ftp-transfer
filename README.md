# Terminal FTP-Transfer Tool
## Description:
My first project in python that creates a basic ftp tool in which a user can use the terminal to navigate into the FTP server and store files from the local machine. This project is focuses primarily in storing files as such it has no feature to retrieve objects from the FTP server.

## Instructions:
1. Download the repo and extract it into your preferred location
2. Select the "Change Server" by using the terminal and respoing with the listed number and follow the directions provided
3. (Optional) select the "Change Credentials" and follow the directions.
4. Press Connect and it should connect to your FTP server.

## Running the application
```
python (Current Directory)\main.py
```
